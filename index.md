Prompt Me is an intentionally vulnerable LLM based application designed as a Capture The Flag (CTF) style challenge. The project serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the practical implications of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications, helping developers, researchers, and security professionals understand how emerging LLM threats can be exploited and mitigated.

This web-based application simulates real-world LLM attack vectors in a controlled environment. Each vulnerability is mapped directly to an OWASP LLM Top 10 risk (such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, embedding manipulation, etc.), and participants are challenged to exploit these flaws to capture hidden flags.
